Hey,
this is a hr managment worker system

## every hr have a username ( email) and password and its declared as users in the server/utils/db.json file

 first we run script : npm i

then we need to have a sql server running in order to deal with databse  
the mysql databse config is in server/config/db.config

after you setup the db config
you can start the server by running
npm run start

browse the app in : localhost:3000
backend server in :localhost:3001

every hr have a set of workers
you can modify the databse (db.json)

thanks .
